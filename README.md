# MovingTurtlesim

Clone this repository to the src file of a workspace. *(e.g., /catkin_ws/src/)*

When installed, you can run one of two launch files:

- To run a turtlesim mode that will move in a circle, run "move_circle.launch".
  
- To run a turtlesim node that will move forward, run the launch file "move_forward.launch". Once the turtlesim node is displayed, enter the distance that you
would like to move forward in the terminal and press enter.

To exit either program, enter Ctrl^C in the terminal
